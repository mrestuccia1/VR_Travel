# VR_Travel
A virtual reality game built with Unity and C#, that visually and audibly instructs the user on how to get from a starting point A to an ending point B. The user can select their desisered start and end poiitn at the start of the game. Then, our application will direct them from start to end. I built this with a partner, Vaughn Richard.

## To Run this Project:
To run this project an Oculus VR device is needed. If intrested in actually running this game, feel free to email! Otherwise, below is an example of how it works.

## An Example:

When selecting your path, this is what the game looks like:

We pre-defined some points, and here we picked the path going from point A to point C.
